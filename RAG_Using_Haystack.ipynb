The title of the episode refers to both Daenerys Targaryen, who was born during a terrible storm, and Euron Greyjoy, who declares himself to be \"the storm\".\\n\\nThe episode\\'s main plot focuses on Daenerys planning her conquest of Westeros; at the behest of Melisandre, she orders Tyrion to summon Jon Snow, who agrees to meet with her despite the objections of Sansa and several other supporters. In King\\'s Landing, Cersei Lannister warns her bannermen about Daenerys\\'s impending invasion. Meanwhile, in the Narrow Sea, the Greyjoys and Sand Snakes are attacked by Euron Greyjoy\\'s Iron Fleet, with Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand being taken as hostages.\\n\\n\"Stormborn\" received praise from critics, who considered Euron Greyjoy\\'s raid on Yara\\'s Iron Fleet, the assembly of Daenerys\\' allies at Dragonstone, and Arya\\'s reunion with her direwolf Nymeria as highlights of the episode.

Daenerys grants an audience to Melisandre, who urges her to meet Jon Snow. Tyrion vouches for Jon and recommends the Starks as allies. Daenerys instructs Tyrion to summon Jon to bend the knee. Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand support an overwhelming offensive on King's Landing. Daenerys doesn't wish to destroy the territory she plans on ruling, but instead adopts Tyrion's plan to have her Westerosi armies besiege King's Landing, while the Unsullied will take Casterly Rock.\\n\\nBefore departing to lead his army, Grey Worm reveals to Missandei he never feared before loving her.

Cogman has been a writer for the series since its beginning, previously writing nine other episodes. The title of the episode, \"Stormborn\", is a reference to Daenerys Targaryen, who was born in the midst of a great storm, earning her that nickname. In the \"Inside the Episode\" segment published by HBO following the initial airing of the episode, co-creators and executive producers of the series David Benioff and D. B. Weiss were interviewed, saying \"We last saw Nymeria when Arya made her run away because she wanted to save Nymeria\\'s life, - She knew Cersei was going to kill her if she found her, and when she finally finds Nymeria again — or Nymeria finds her — she of course wants Nymeria to come back home with her and be her loyal companion again.

Weiss continued, \"Arya\\'s not domesticated. It makes total sense the wolf wouldn\\'t be either. Once the wolf walks away, at first she\\'s heartbroken to have come this close, but then she realizes the wolf is doing exactly what she would do if she was that wolf.\"===Casting===\\nThe episode featured the return of Ben Hawkey as Hot Pie, who was last seen in season 4\\'s \"Mockingbird\". Hawkey spoke about his return to \\'\\'Entertainment Weekly\\'\\', saying that he did not expect to ever come back. Prior to getting the script and to avoid the return of character to be leaked, the producers gave Hawkey a code name when communicating by email.

He joined the series as a director in the fifth season, his first episode being \"High Sparrow\", which was followed by \"Sons of the Harpy\". John Bradley spoke about what went into shooting the Jorah Mormont greyscale scene with actor Iain Glen.

House Lannister has an associated song, \"The Rains of Castamere\", which became their theme.

The theme for Daenerys Targaryen started small, but became grander as she became more powerful. Her theme was initially played with a single instrument such as a processed cello, but later began incorporating more instruments, including Japanese taiko-inspired drums, Indonesian bedug drums, and an Armenian duduk flute.

Seeking an advantage to counter the PS4 faction's increasing ranks, Cartman contacts Microsoft, but CEO Steve Ballmer dismisses the importance of the children's conflict and the commercialization of the console wars. When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates learns of this, he has Ballmer murdered in order to personally see to it that Xbox wins the console wars. Gates allies himself with Channel 9's ''Morning News'' correspondent Niles Lawson, promising that the Black Friday violence will ensure high ratings. Lawson, playing both sides of the conflict, then informs Sony's CEO of this during a post-coital discussion, and in response, the CEO gives Kenny a brooch that turns him into a Japanese princess.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '29cd6f17c482752f0e59a433cbd6febe'}>,\n",

Publicis London, the advertising agency, generated this campaign to help a global audience understand this shift in employment.\\n\\nThe tapestry was made from material which represents that of the late 18th century (linen) and a technique passed on from generations (embroidery).

The game's primary designer is Eric Lang, the lead developer is Nate French, with Damon Stone serving as associate designer.\\n\\nIn the game, players assume the leadership of one of the great houses of Westeros vying for control of King's Landing and the Iron Throne. To accomplish this, players launch military attacks against their opponents, undermine their opponents’ plans with intrigues of their own, and make power plays to win the support of the realm.\\n\\n==Factions==\\nEach house represents one of the main factions involved in the struggle for the Iron Throne emulated by the AGoT LCG. Each house provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various play styles to interact within the same game.

He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored music had to be omitted so as not to get in the way of dialogue. Djawadi also evolved the themes with the characters, noting in a 2017 interview that Daenerys\\' theme \"initially plays on a couple of instruments on top of the Dothraki music. It’s almost like it doesn’t have its own identity yet. It sets itself apart during the finale of Season 1 when the dragon eggs hatch.\"Djawadi said that he was inspired to write the main title music by an early version of the series\\'s computer-animated title sequence.  The theme would be repeated all through the series, particularly at important scenes. Many of the recordings were done by solo musicians, while the larger pieces are recorded with a full orchestra and a choir in Prague.

He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.\\n\\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called ''Avalon''. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 6}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '20a622e0e5d75856d0b55662e0371f66'}>,\n",

He continued by saying that they knew it would be important for the Night King to seize on the opportunity to kill a dragon, and that they intended for the scene to be a \"one-two punch\" by having the viewer witness \"the horror\" involved with seeing \"one of these three amazing beings like this in the world going under the water and not coming up again, and processing that,\" but also \"processing something that\\'s even worse,\" by having the dragon pulled out of the water and becoming a part of the Night King\\'s army.\\n\\nRegarding the inclusion of the wight polar bear attack, Benioff and Weiss stated that they had wanted to have a wight polar bear for \"about four seasons,\" but never made it onto the screen due to opposition from the special effects team.

However, with \"Beyond the Wall\", he was able to fully utilize visual effects to create the large environment, dragons and armies due to the increased budget.
